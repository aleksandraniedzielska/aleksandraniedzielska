I am a graduate from a Polish university, where I studied Genetics and Medical Biology. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to attend a scholarship program at the University of La Laguna in Tenerife. It was there that I developed a specialized code aimed at advancing research in Alzheimer's disease. The code I created is rooted in medical knowledge, focusing on lipid raftsâ€”crucial components involved in the progression of the disease.

The code generates a graphic representation of lipid rafts, taking into account various lipid types and their mobility within the structure. By modeling the interactions among these elements, the code offers insights into how changes in lipid raft formation can impact Alzheimer's disease progression. This tool has the potential to aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disease and how alterations in lipid dynamics may influence its development.
